## About
[Linked Data Platform (LDP)](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/) is a standard describing set of HTTP operations that are capable of read/write of ([RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/)) data. The objective of this thesis is to explore usage of LDP to implement a data catalog. Catalog should be able to maintain metadata about datasets on the basis of the [DCAT](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/) specification.

THe author will familiarize with relevant standards and describe some use cases of usage of the data catalog. Then on the basis of the use cases will design implementation of data catalog using the LDP. The author will also implement specification (or a relevant part) of the LDP with Python language and also implement POC proposed extension for data catalog needs.
